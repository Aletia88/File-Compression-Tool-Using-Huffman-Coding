Data Compression:
Data compression refers to the process of reducing the size of data to save space or transmission time. The goal is to represent the data in a more compact form while maintaining its integrity. Compression techniques can be broadly categorized into two types:

Lossless Compression:

Definition: In lossless compression, no data is lost, and the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
Applications: Text files, executables, or data used for archival purposes (e.g., .zip, .gzip).
Algorithms:
Huffman Coding: It uses variable-length codes to represent frequent data with shorter codes and rare data with longer codes.
Run-Length Encoding (RLE): This method represents consecutive repeated data with a single value and a count.
Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW): A dictionary-based compression algorithm often used in file formats like .gif and .png.
Lossy Compression:
